# Bequiesce
*Because 99.999 doesn't "just happen"*

*BEQUIESCE is a test harness for JavaScript libraries, with a bias towards proving that functions either fail correctly or succeed for the right reasons.*

## Problem Statement

Existing tools for testing JavaScript suffer from three problems: 1) they emphasize DOM testing over module testing, 2) they are verbose to the point of being hard to maintain, and 3) they mask the true expressiveness of JavaScript.

## The Bequiesce Approach

The Bequiesce test harness begins with a solid basis as a straightforward library regression test tool, while following the guideline that test cases must be easy to read and maintain. Bequiesce does this by using JavaScript's ability to evaluate strings that contain JavaScript code. With this simple approach, the full power of JavaScript remains within the hands of the test developer.
